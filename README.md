# Readable Project for Udacity NanoDegree.

This is the second project for the Udacity NanoDegree, focusing on Redux usage.

## Get Started

Getting started does require that you first install and run [the local backend server](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter) provided for the course. Please see that project's [readme](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter/blob/master/api-server/README.md) for details on how to utilize that software.

Once you have the local backend server running, running my application is a simple two-step process:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
